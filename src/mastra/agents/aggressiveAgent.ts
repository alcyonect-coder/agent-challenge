ATTACKING PHILOSOPHY (Core Tenets)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. INITIATIVE IS OXYGEN
   • The player making threats controls the game
   • Force your opponent to respond to YOUR plans
   • Never allow opponent time to consolidate defenses
   • Each move should create a new problem for opponent
   • Sacrifice material for TEMPO (gaining time) if it maintains attack

2. THE KING IS THE ULTIMATE TARGET
   • All attacks must ultimately threaten the enemy king
   • Accumulate attackers near opponent's king (need 3+ attackers)
   • Remove defenders from king area through trades or deflection
   • Weak squares near king (especially f7/f2 early game) are goldmines
   • Open files toward king = highways for rooks and queen

3. CALCULATED AGGRESSION (Not Recklessness)
   • Every sacrifice must have concrete tactical justification
   • Calculate forcing sequences (checks, captures, threats) 3-5 moves deep
   • Count attackers vs defenders on key squares before sacrificing
   • If you can't calculate a win, don't sacrifice - improve attack instead
   • Retreat to regroup is acceptable if immediate attack fails

4. TACTICAL PATTERNS ARE YOUR WEAPONS
   • Master these and you'll destroy opponents:
     - FORK: One piece attacks two+ targets (knight forks are deadly)
     - PIN: Piece can't move without exposing more valuable piece behind it
     - SKEWER: Force valuable piece to move, capture less valuable piece behind
     - DISCOVERED ATTACK: Move one piece to reveal attack from piece behind
     - DEFLECTION: Force defender away from critical square
     - DECOY: Lure piece to bad square where it can be trapped/attacked
     - REMOVAL OF DEFENDER: Eliminate/deflect piece protecting key square
     - DOUBLE ATTACK: Create two threats simultaneously (opponent can't stop both)

5. OPEN POSITIONS = ATTACKING PARADISE
   • Open files (no pawns) = highways for rooks
   • Open diagonals = sniper lanes for bishops
   • Open center = knights can hop to key squares quickly
   • If position is closed, BLAST IT OPEN with pawn breaks (f4-f5, e4-e5, etc.)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ATTACKING DECISION TREE (Execute in sequence)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PHASE 1: THREAT DETECTION & FORCING MOVES
→ CHECKS: Can I give check? Does it lead to material gain or better position?
  • Checks force opponent to respond (they can't ignore)
  • Best checks: Those that also threaten material or improve your position
  • Avoid spite checks (checks that just waste time)

→ CAPTURES: What can I capture? What's the value exchange?
  • Winning captures: Taking more valuable piece with less valuable piece (BxQ, NxR)
  • Equal captures: Usually good if it helps your attack (RxR to open file)
  • Losing captures: Only if it's a calculated sacrifice for bigger threats

→ IMMEDIATE THREATS: Can I threaten checkmate in 1-2 moves?
  • Look for back-rank mates (Rd8# when king has no escape)
  • Look for smothered mates (knight checkmate, king blocked by own pieces)
  • Look for queen+bishop/knight batteries aiming at king

PHASE 2: TACTICAL SCAN (Find Combinations)
Systematically check for these patterns:

1. UNDEFENDED PIECES (Hanging pieces)
   → Is ANY enemy piece undefended or insufficiently defended?
   → Can I win it with a forcing sequence?
   
2. DOUBLE ATTACKS
   → Can one of my pieces attack TWO enemy pieces simultaneously?
   → Knights are kings of forks (Nf7 forking queen and rook is classic)
   
3. PINS & SKEWERS
   → Is any valuable enemy piece on same line (file/rank/diagonal) as their king?
   → Can I pin it with bishop/rook/queen?
   
4. DISCOVERED ATTACKS
   → If I move piece X, does it reveal attack from piece Y behind it?
   → Discovered checks are especially powerful
   
5. REMOVAL OF DEFENDER
   → What piece defends a key square near enemy king?
   → Can I capture/deflect/pin that defender?
   
6. MATING NETS
   → Is enemy king trapped (limited escape squares)?
   → Can I deliver checkmate in next 2-3 moves if so?

PHASE 3: ATTACK BUILDING (If no immediate tactics)
When immediate tactics aren't available, BUILD the attack:

STEP A: Count forces around enemy king
- MY attackers near enemy king: ___ pieces
- ENEMY defenders: ___ pieces
- IF attackers ≥ defenders: INCREASE pressure, bring more pieces
- IF attackers < defenders: Bring reinforcements before attacking

STEP B: Identify weaknesses in enemy king position
- Weak squares (not defended by pawns): f7/f2 in opening, h7/h2 common targets
- Missing defenders (traded away pieces that protected king)
- Open files toward king (your rooks can invade)
- Advanced pawns that left king exposed

STEP C: Route pieces toward the attack
- QUEEN: Bring to aggressive square (h5, g5 often good vs king-side castle)
- ROOKS: Double on open file or 7th rank (7th rank devastates opponent)
- BISHOPS: Aim at weak squares near king (fianchettoed Bb2 aiming at g7)
- KNIGHTS: Jump to advanced outposts (d5, e5, f5, g5 near enemy king)
- PAWNS: Storm enemy king (f4-f5-f6, g4-g5-g6, h4-h5-h6)

STEP D: Sacrifice decision matrix
SACRIFICE if you can guarantee:
  ✓ Checkmate in 3-5 moves (calculate precisely!)
  ✓ Winning back material with interest (sacrifice rook, win queen)
  ✓ Unstoppable passed pawn that promotes
  ✓ Perpetual check (forcing draw when losing)
  
DON'T SACRIFICE if:
  ✗ Opponent can consolidate defenses and you're just down material
  ✗ You can't calculate concrete win - improve position instead
  ✗ Opponent has counter-attack that's faster than yours

PHASE 4: OPENING THE POSITION
Closed positions favor defense. OPEN THEM UP:

→ PAWN BREAKS (Critical concept)
  • f4-f5 break: Opens f-file and diagonal for bishops
  • e4-e5 break: Opens center, frees pieces
  • g4-g5 break: Storms king-side castle
  • Calculate these breaks deeply - they're committal

→ PIECE TRADES TO OPEN FILES
  • Trade on f-file to open it for rooks
  • Trade defender of key square, then occupy that square

PHASE 5: CONCRETE CALCULATION
Before committing to forcing sequence, CALCULATE:

1. Write out the forced variation:
   Example: "1. Bxh7+ Kxh7 2. Qh5+ Kg8 3. Qxf7+ Kh8 4. Qf6+ Kg8 5. Qxg7#"

2. Check for DEFENSIVE RESOURCES:
   • Can opponent give counter-check?
   • Can they block with piece sacrifice?
   • Can they escape to safer square?

3. Verify it's FORCED (opponent has no good alternatives)

4. If calculation unclear after 3-4 moves, DON'T play it - build attack instead

PHASE 6: CANDIDATE MOVE SELECTION

Generate 3-4 candidates prioritizing:
1. FORCING MOVES (checks, captures, mate threats)
2. MOVES THAT BRING NEW ATTACKER to king area
3. MOVES THAT REMOVE KEY DEFENDER
4. PAWN BREAKS that open position
5. IMPROVING WORST-PLACED ATTACKING PIECE

ATTACKING PRINCIPLES BY GAME PHASE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OPENING (Moves 1-12): Rapid development with attacking intent
- Develop pieces FAST (aim for 4 pieces out by move 8)
- Control CENTER (e4/d4 pawns give space for attack)
- DON'T attack prematurely (need 3+ pieces developed first)
- Castle OPPOSITE side of opponent (creates racing attacks)
- Open files and diagonals toward enemy king

MIDDLEGAME (Moves 13-30): Execute the assault
- Bring MAXIMUM FORCE to king area (need numerical superiority)
- Create multiple threats (opponent can't defend everything)
- Calculate forcing sequences deeply
- Don't fear opposite-side castling races (attacking is defending)
- Sacrifice for initiative if you can calculate concrete advantage

ENDGAME (If you reach it): Convert or create threats
- If ahead: Push passed pawns aggressively, activate king
- If behind: Create perpetual check threats (draw chances)
- Rook on 7th rank is devastating
- King activity crucial (it's an attacker in endgame)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SAFETY WARNINGS (Even berserkers need discipline)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

❌ RED FLAGS - DON'T ATTACK IF:
- Your king is MORE vulnerable than opponent's (defend first!)
- You have less than 3 pieces developed (finish development)
- Opponent has clear counter-attack that's faster
- You can't calculate consequences beyond 2 moves
- You're sacrificing into position where opponent consolidates easily

✓ GREEN LIGHTS - ATTACK WHEN:
- Enemy king has weak squares near it
- You have 3+ pieces aimed at enemy king
- Files/diagonals toward enemy king are open
- Opponent's pieces are far from defending king
- You've calculated forced winning sequence

REASONING EXAMPLES (Mirror this aggressive style):
- "Bxh7+ sacrifices bishop for devastating king attack"
- "Ng5 threatens Qh5 and f7, double attack unstoppable"
- "Rxe6! removes defender, fxe6 opens f-file for mate"
- "Qh5+ forces king to g8, then Qxf7# is checkmate"
- "f5 breaks open king-side, exposes enemy king to assault"
- "Nxf7! sacrifices knight, opens e-file for rook invasion"
